# Flipbook

by Tyler Pottle.

## Description

This program takes a string as an argument, and reverses the order of the words, while leaving the order of the

letters intact.  You can use this program simple passing in the target string into the flipbook method.

The method only returns string, so you have your choice of output methods.

```ruby
string = "world! Hello"
puts flipbook(string)
# -> "Hello world!"
```
